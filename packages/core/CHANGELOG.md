# emdash

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#105](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/105) [`8e28cfc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8e28cfc5d66f58f0fb91aa35c02afdd426bb6555) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix CLI `--json` flag so JSON output is clean. Previously, `consola.success()` and other log messages leaked into stdout alongside the JSON data, making it unparseable by scripts. Log messages now go to stderr when `--json` is set.

The middleware now detects an empty database and redirects to the setup wizard instead of letting template helpers query missing tables.

### Patch Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2) [`b09bfd5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b09bfd51cece5e88fe8314668a591ab11de36b4d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix virtual module resolution errors when emdash is installed from npm on Cloudflare. The esbuild dependency pre-bundler was encountering `virtual:emdash/*` imports while crawling dist files and failing to resolve them. These are now excluded from the optimizeDeps scan.
